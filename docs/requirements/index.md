I'll provide an English version of the detailed requirements analysis report for the Bulletin Board System.

# Bulletin Board System Requirements Detailed Analysis Report

## 1. System Overview

This system is a web-based Bulletin Board System that allows users to create posts and communicate through comments. The most distinctive feature of this system is its snapshot-based history management mechanism that preserves all content revision histories to maintain evidence and verify authenticity in case of disputes among users.

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1 Evidence Preservation Mechanism

The most critical requirement of the system is to thoroughly preserve the revision history of all content (posts and comments). This should be implemented as follows:

1. **Snapshot-based History Management**:
   - When a post or comment is first created, an initial snapshot is generated
   - Each time content is modified, a new snapshot is additionally created
   - Existing snapshots are never modified or deleted
   - Each snapshot must include information such as content, creation time, IP address, etc.

2. **Logical Deletion Method**:
   - When posts or comments are deleted, they are not actually removed from the database
   - Instead, a deletion time (deleted_at) is recorded for logical deletion
   - Deleted items should not be visible to general users but should be accessible for administrative purposes

3. **Modification Verification Elements**:
   - All snapshots must record the author's IP address
   - All actions must have precise timestamps
   - Password verification is required for modification/deletion

### 2.2 Post Functionality Requirements

1. **Post Creation**:
   - Users must be able to create posts including title and body
   - Author name and password input are required when creating posts
   - The body should be writable in various formats (HTML, Markdown, plain text, etc.)
   - File attachment functionality must be supported

2. **Post Viewing**:
   - The post list should display the title of the latest version
   - The detail page should primarily display the latest version of content
   - It should be possible to view previous versions (snapshots) as needed
   - Attached file list and download functionality should be provided

3. **Post Modification**:
   - Authors can modify posts after password verification
   - Modification creates a new snapshot while preserving existing content
   - Attachments should also be modifiable (add/delete/reorder)

4. **Post Deletion**:
   - Authors can delete posts after password verification
   - Deletion must be implemented as logical deletion (soft delete)
   - Deleted posts should be excluded from general viewing but accessible for administrative purposes

### 2.3 Comment Functionality Requirements

1. **Comment Creation**:
   - Users must be able to create comments on posts
   - Author name and password input are required when creating comments
   - The body should be writable in various formats
   - File attachment functionality must be supported

2. **Hierarchical Comment Structure**:
   - It should be possible to write replies to comments (nested comments)
   - The hierarchical relationship between replies and original comments should be visually represented
   - The hierarchical structure should support unlimited depth

3. **Comment Modification**:
   - Authors can modify comments after password verification
   - Modification creates a new snapshot while preserving existing content
   - Attachments should also be modifiable

4. **Comment Deletion**:
   - Authors can delete comments after password verification
   - Deletion must be implemented as logical deletion
   - Deleted comments should be excluded from general viewing but accessible for administrative purposes

### 2.4 File Attachment Requirements

1. **File Upload**:
   - It should be possible to attach files when creating/modifying posts and comments
   - Upload of various file formats should be supported
   - Filenames and extensions should be managed separately (files without extensions should also be processable)

2. **File Management**:
   - Attached files should be displayed in a specific order (sequence)
   - Users should be able to specify or change the file order
   - Files should be accessible via unique URLs

3. **File Download**:
   - Users should be able to download attached files
   - Files should be provided with the original filename when downloaded

## 3. Non-functional Requirements

### 3.1 Security Requirements

1. **Password Security**:
   - Passwords for posts and comments must be stored securely encrypted
   - Password verification is required for modification/deletion

2. **IP Address Recording**:
   - IP addresses must be recorded for all creation and modification actions
   - IP address information should have appropriate access restrictions for security reasons

3. **Access Control**:
   - General users should not be able to access deleted posts/comments
   - Only administrators should have access to deleted items

### 3.2 Performance Requirements

1. **Viewing Performance Optimization**:
   - Latest snapshot information should be efficiently retrievable when viewing post lists and details
   - Posts with many comments should load quickly

2. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Appropriate indexes should be configured for frequently queried fields
   - Time-based sorting and filtering should operate quickly

3. **File Processing Performance**:
   - Large file uploads/downloads should be handled smoothly
   - Performance degradation should be minimized even when attaching multiple files

### 3.3 Scalability Requirements

1. **Data Growth Management**:
   - The system should continue to operate stably even as the number of posts and comments increases
   - Data growth due to the snapshot approach should be efficiently managed

2. **User Growth Management**:
   - System performance should be maintained even as the number of simultaneous users increases

## 4. User Interface Requirements

   - Display post title, author, creation date, comment count
   - Provide pagination functionality
   - Provide search functionality

2. **Post Detail Screen**:
   - Display title, body, author, creation date

## 6. Conclusion and Implementation Considerations

The most prominent feature of this bulletin board system is its mechanism to thoroughly preserve the revision history of all content to maintain evidence and verify authenticity in case of disputes among users. This design considers the risks of disputes that can occur due to the nature of e-communities.

The following points should be particularly considered during implementation:

1. **Data Growth Management**: As data continuously increases due to the snapshot approach, efficient storage and retrieval methods are necessary.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Methods to quickly retrieve the latest snapshots are needed. Performance should be optimized using view tables and other techniques.

3. **Security Enhancement**: Sensitive information such as passwords and IP addresses must be managed securely.

4. **User Experience**: Despite having history management functionality, an intuitive and convenient interface should be provided to general users.

Based on this requirements analysis report, the development team should be able to implement a highly reliable bulletin board system. The focus should be on building a user-friendly system while achieving the core objectives of evidence preservation and dispute prevention.
